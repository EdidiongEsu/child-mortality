# Child-mortality

This repository contains the coding materials I used in reading and analyzing data gotten from UNICEF. It is  mortality based analysis that focuses on the trend of child death from malaria in Nigeria and its neighbouring countries with respect to the whole world. The full visualization writeup can be read [here](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22/global-reduction-in-infant-mortality-864d1879a217). The writeup contains the link to the unicef website.
